# c language
This repo is made to store the c file 

``` shell
#include<stdio.h>
```
This a header part of c programming language this is used for printing the data `print statement` and taking input formerement` 
``` shell
int main(){

}
```
This is a main function of c programming whatever is thenside `main()` function it will execute that.

# short c program for printing Hello world
```shell
#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
  printf("hello world");
  }
```
As this `main()` function is of void type it can not return any value.

# how to take input form user 
```shell
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a;
  printf("Enter the value for a:");
  scanf("%d",&a);
  printf("user enter number is %d",a);
  return 0;
}
```
This program will going to take value form user and print it .
This all is possible due to `scanf()` which allow user to take input form user and by help of `printf()` we print that value.
